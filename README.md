# Small App

## Description  

As a busy coach I'm a bit short on time, so I've provided user stories below so you can build one for me. Your challenge is to build a 'Daily Diary' application that uses Sinatra together with a PostgreSQL to store diary entries, and has a browser-based user interface. 

## User Stories 

## MVP 

```
As a user
So that I can keep a daily diary
I want to be able to add a new Diary Entry
``` 

```  
As a user
So that I can identify my entry in future
I want to give each Diary Entry a title
``` 

```  
As a user
So that I can browse my previous entries
I want to see a list of Diary Entry Titles
``` 

``` 
As a user
So that I can read my previous entries
I want to click on a title to see the full Diary Entry
```
